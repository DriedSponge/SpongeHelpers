# About
This is the library I made to replace jQuery in all of my projects because jQuery is bloated with things that are no longer needed.

I made this repository public in case I needed to show/reference the code anywhere, but other than that I will not be supporting it. Do not expect:

- Issues to be read
- Documentation
- Pull request to be accepted

You can try to use it or take code from it (I don't really care), just don't expect any help.
